# Air Shortcuts

Air Shortcuts lets you control your Mac using head movements detected by supported AirPods. Assign actions to Up, Down, Left, and Right gestures to manage media, adjust volume or brightness, trigger keyboard shortcuts without using your hands, or use the **Wake Me** feature to stay alert with an inactivity alarm.

## Wake Me

The **Wake Me** feature acts as an inactivity alarm, perfect for when you need to stay alert or awake at your desk. It monitors your continuous head movements and triggers an alert if no activity is detected for a specified duration.

**Configuration Settings:**
* **Movement Sensitivity:** Adjust how much head movement is required to reset the inactivity timer.
* **Timeout Duration:** Set the continuous inactivity time (in minutes and seconds) before the alarm triggers.
* **Alert Sound:** Choose from a wide variety of macOS system sounds and iOS-style ringtones.

## Requirements

* macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
* Devices with head-tracking support:

  * AirPods Pro (1st/2nd gen)
  * AirPods (3rd gen)
  * AirPods Max
  * Beats Fit Pro
    *(Standard AirPods 1/2 do not include motion sensors.)*

## Battery Impact

Motion tracking uses more power while active, so AirPods may drain faster during use. This behavior is similar to features like Spatial Audio, which rely on the same motion sensors. Stopping tracking returns battery usage to normal. It does not harm hardware, though more frequent charging can contribute to typical long-term battery wear.
